                <h3 id="headline">Here's some of the important inventions of Tesla:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AC and the induction motor</strong> - Tesla met two men, Brown and Peck, who agreed to financially back and handle his patents. They formed the Tesla Electric Company in 1887, and Tesla developed an AC induction motor that year which was patented in 1888. The motor was publicly demonstrated, and caught the attention of George Westinghouse who needed it for his AC power system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tesla coil</strong> - Tesla learned about Hertz's discovery of electromagnetic radiation and radio waves at 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and decided to explore it further. He invented the "oscillating transformer," also known as the Tesla coil, to fix the problem of overheating in Ruhmkorff coil and this coil is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity. He also used this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wireless lighting</strong> - In the 1890s, Tesla experimented with transmitting power wirelessly using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil. He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted public demonstrations. Despite the help of various investors, none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polyphase system and the Columbian Exposition</strong> - In 1893, Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago with alternating current. The company had a large space in the "Electricity Building" devoted to electrical exhibits and demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of an alternating current system that was polyphase and could also supply the other AC and DC exhibits at the fair. Tesla was invited to participate in the exposition and put on a series of demonstrations at the Westinghouse exhibit. He showed his wireless lighting system using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light wireless gas-discharge lamps. An observer noted that these were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous.</li>
                    <li><strong>Steam-powered oscillating generator</strong> - During his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, Tesla introduced his steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Radio remote control</strong> - Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of "invisible" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments[131] (later identified as "Roentgen rays" or "X-rays"). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen's December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube.</li>
                    <li><strong>X-ray experimentation</strong> - n 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed "telautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.[139] Tesla tried to sell his idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wireless power</strong> - In the 1890s through 1906, Tesla attempted to develop the transmission of electrical power and communications without wires using coils. He believed that this would be a way to transmit large amounts of power and communications around the world. At the time, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances or large amounts of power. Tesla studied radio waves early on and came to the conclusion that they were not suitable for his intended purposes. He then experimented with the idea of conducting electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and set up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his lab to test this idea. He proposed a system of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet in altitude, where he thought the lower pressure would allow for the transmission of high voltages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bladeless turbine</strong> - On his 50th birthday in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower bladeless turbine. From 1910 to 1911, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100-5,000 horsepower at the Waterside Power Station in New York. Tesla worked with several companies, including Allis-Chalmers from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, to try to perfect the turbine, but engineering difficulties prevented it from becoming a practical device. Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company, and it found use in luxury car speedometers and other instruments.</li>
